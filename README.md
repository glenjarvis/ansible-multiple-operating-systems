# Chapter 9: Managing different Operating Systems with Ansible

## Objective

What if we had two code bases developed by different teams. Imagine that one
team is a pure RedHat team. And, the second team is a pure Debian team.

Both teams have used Ansible a long time. And, they've used it in a fairly
organized manner (e.g., using Roles properly).

However, now the teams need to share their code bases. This chapter will show
how to work effectively where both teams can share and they don't interfere
with the other team's work. In fact, some pretty synergestic collaboration can
happen.

How will we pull this off? By sharing some industry standards that make this
fall into place fairly easily.



## Examples
